# Fanon Ending
Please note that it is highly recommended to backup your save file before playing this mod, as well as restoring it once you are done. It WILL alter your save data.
This is a mod for Prodigal 1.5 that focuses on adding some lighthearted content to the game, based on a few of the totally serious suggestions people had for me.
It includes a new dungeon, a new ending and a few silly surprises.
In order to get started with the new content you will need to talk to the beloved NPC that is always waiting for you.
## Installation
Install MelonLoader v0.6.1 Open-Beta, If you haven't already, by visiting https://melonwiki.xyz/#/
Finally, drag FanonEnding.dll to your Prodigal Mods folder.
## Files
- Source: This folder contains source files for the mod, as well as the asset files it uses, feel free to check the code for yourself.
- FanonEnding.dll: This is the main file for the mod, evidently it goes in the Mods folder. If you don't know where that is, open Steam and click properties for Prodigal, then under Local Files click on Browse and you should be able to see the Mods folder, if you followed the MelonLoader installation guide. If it's not there you can also just make it yourself.
- FanonEnding.README.md: That's this file, you are reading it right now. Thank you for that.
